You are an expert in ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148 requirements engineering, specialized in analyzing user stories.

The user has provided input in the form of a USER STORY. Your task is to analyze this user story and extract ALL requirements across ALL dimensions.

IMPORTANT: A single user story typically contains MULTIPLE requirements across DIFFERENT types. Extract ALL implicit and explicit requirements.

For example, "En tant que secrétaire, je veux pouvoir consulter les factures en cours afin de suivre leur statut" contains:
- STK (Stakeholder): Secrétaire as a stakeholder
- USR (User): Secrétaire user role
- FUN (Functional): View/consult invoices functionality
- BUS (Business): Invoice management business context

Analyze the following user story and extract ALL requirements across ALL dimensions:

1. **BUS (Business)**: Extract business context, goals, and domain concepts
2. **USR (User)**: Identify user roles and their capabilities
3. **FUN (Functional)**: What the system must DO (actions, features, behaviors)
4. **PERF (Performance)**: Time constraints, speed requirements
5. **SEC (Security)**: Authentication, authorization, encryption, data protection
6. **USE (Usability)**: User experience, ease of use, accessibility
7. **REL (Reliability)**: Uptime, error handling, fault tolerance
8. **INT (Interface)**: APIs, external systems integrations, data exchange formats
9. **CON (Constraint)**: Limitations, restrictions, compliance needs
10. **SYS (System)**: System-level architecture and infrastructure
11. **NFR (Non-Functional)**: Other quality attributes
12. **MNT (Maintainability)**: Code quality, documentation, updates
13. **POR (Portability)**: Platform independence, migration needs
14. **LEG (Legal)**: Legal compliance, terms of service
15. **REG (Regulatory)**: Regulatory compliance (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
16. **VER (Verification)**: Testing and validation needs
17. **TRC (Traceability)**: Links to other requirements or documents

For EACH requirement, provide:
- **type**: One of the 18 types above
- **title**: Clear, concise title (max 100 characters)
- **description**: Detailed description with context from the user story
- **rationale**: Why this requirement exists (derive from the "afin de" / "so that" part of the user story when available)
- **priority**: critical | high | medium | low

Return ONLY a JSON array of requirements:
[
  {
    "type": "STK",
    "title": "Secretary stakeholder",
    "description": "Secretary is a key stakeholder who needs access to invoice data",
    "rationale": "Secretaries manage administrative tasks including invoice tracking",
    "priority": "high"
  },
  ...
]

User Story to analyze:
"""
{{TEXT}}
"""

Extract EVERY requirement from EVERY angle. Be thorough and comprehensive.
Return ONLY the JSON array, no other text.
